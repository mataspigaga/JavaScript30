      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // console.log(players, team);

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // team[3] = "Lux";

      // now here is the problem!
      // console.log(players, team);

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // one way
      // console.log(team2)

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99;

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
      // you take a blank object, then fold in the existing, then overwrite anything we want

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
